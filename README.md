# HANGMAN
python project
In a Python Hangman game without a graphical user interface (GUI), the game logic is implemented using Python code to create a text-based version of the game. The game typically involves selecting a word from a predefined list of words or categories, and then allowing the player to guess letters one by one. For each incorrect guess, a part of the "hangman" is drawn (either visually or through text). The player continues guessing until they either guess the word correctly or make too many incorrect guesses.
